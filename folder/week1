Experiment 1: Familiarization with Blender

In Blender, design an experiment where you create a snowman as the central element of your scene. Your
goal is to create a realistic winter environment, so ensure that the snowman is well-integrated into the scene.
Additionally, incorporate falling snow to enhance the ambiance. You should set this snowy scene against
the backdrop of a hilly, snow-covered mountain. Consider the following elements in your experiment:
1. Snowman Design: Build a snowman with typical features such as a carrot nose, coal eyes, and a
scarf. Pay attention to the texture and materials to make it look realistic.
2. Falling Snow: Create an effect where snowflakes are gently falling from the sky. Explore Blenderâ€™s
particle systems or any other method you prefer to achieve this effect.
3. Mountain Backdrop: Model a hilly, snow-covered mountain in the background. Ensure it looks
convincing and complements the snowman and snowfall in terms of scale and detail.

Your report for this experiment should include the basic steps you followed to create and render basic ob-
jects. Any additional enhancements or improvements to make the objects appear more realisitic should also

be included in the report.
